### _“ If you see me collapse, please pause my Garmin “_ [1]

The humble Garmin watch is a symbol, metaphor and literal manifestation of a solution to an important puzzle. It’s one that I’ve encountered in all domains across the past two decades be it professional or personal. How does one discern, filter and process feedback of all different kinds? 

More importantly, how does one filter out the agendas or fuzzy manipulators in these sources, human or otherwise, to ensure that one remains on the path of sustained, unstoppable and a juggernaut like arc of progress?

The watch demonstrates how such a filter would work. Basically, to discern value and truthiness of feedback in a context, try to see how distant it is to say the Garmin watch. The watch does not lie, it’s non-political and has very defined limits of operations ( as well as error mode ). I call this the “ Garmin distance “ in honor of the Hamming distance [2].

If somebody or some source of feedback does not grant an understanding of the precise and minimum number of changes to be made toward measurable progress, you’ve to look elsewhere.

Constructive, gentle, precise, actionable feedback is a time-machine to a better future. So is ignoring and ruthlessly eliminating the rest. Higher the stakes, the more literal this mechanism must be.
