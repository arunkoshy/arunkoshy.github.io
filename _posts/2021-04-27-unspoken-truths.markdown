### _“ Everybody's got a right to be a sucker ... once. “_ [1]

Bit's I've learned across 14 years:

0) Fear G-d and keep His commandments [0]. This one is what got me out unscathed even as I missed the mark on the other 13 truths.

a) Moms are true prophets.. they have serious skin in the game. Time has a weird way of proving them right even if you thought they had no clue.

b) Most ventures fail. So while you listen to pied-piper visionary Steve the CEO, keep in mind basic math around "hyper-scale" or even " success " [2]. If so blessed, talk to friends are VCs, preferably LPs. Outcomes include acquisition with double-digit % layoffs ( usually all but non-core engineering ) to absolute write-offs.

c) Take care of your immigration bits and never let it be a leverage that anybody can play with over your hunt. Remember this song while you do it:

" So if you want to push, I'ma shove
If you want to spar we can do it no gloves
And if you're gonna run at me you better do it hard
Cuz I fear no fall, no brawl, no scars " [3]

d) If there is an at-will contract involved, whatever the context is. It ain't family. Run for your life if you hear how something is like family or even references to Mother Teresa. Saints are laughed out of gambling dens and if you are hearing said bits in such a den, run a few miles.

e) If you have multiple offers and one of them offers a significant pay-bump, listen to the pied piper who will pay you more even if they award you a lesser title. Watch for the fine-print in contracts.

f) Don't be surprised at friendships getting frayed or weird within the work drama -- expect it and show a lot of grace. Ensure that the friendship survives while you learn more about the game.

g) Have as much resources ( read as capital, leverage, equity ) as the folks sitting across the table if you want a deal that is among equals. All the rest are some variation on employment.

For the remaining six, I hold them close to chest. They cost a fair quid and I suspect everybody has to figure those out on their own. Happy trails.
