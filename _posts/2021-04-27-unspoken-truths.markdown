### _“ Everybody's got a right to be a sucker ... once. “_ [1]

Bit's I've learned across 14 years:

0) Fear G-d [0]. This one is what got me out unscathed even as I missed the mark on the other truths.

a) My parents are true prophets.. they have serious skin in the game. Time has a weird way of proving them right even if I thought they had no clue. Due to a broken world, I understand this may not be true for all. True prophets == serious skin in the game.. they are usually teachers, mentors, parental archetypes.

b) Most ventures fail. So while you listen to pied-piper visionary Steve the CEO, keep in mind basic math around "hyper-scale" or even " success " [2]. If so blessed, talk to friends who are VCs, LPs. Outcomes ranges from acquisition with double-digit % layoffs ( usually all but non-core engineering ) to absolute write-offs. The big whale outcomes are statistically a long-lost cousin of some of them mega lotteries.

c) Take care of your immigration bits and never let it be something an employer can lord over with. This song applies to this and a few other truths:

" So if you want to push, I'ma shove
If you want to spar we can do it no gloves
And if you're gonna run at me you better do it hard
Cuz I fear no fall, no brawl, no scars " [3]

d) If there is an at-will contract involved, whatever the context is.. It ain't family. Run for your life if you hear how something is like family or  references to Mother Teresa. Saints are rarely in gambling dens and if you are in such a den, don't expect virtue.

e) If you have multiple offers and one of them offers a significant pay-bump, take that. Only other factor is how healthy the organization is from a capital perspective (so it's probalistically smarter to take a 200K with a mega-corp vs the " startup "). Watch for the fine-print in contracts.

f) Don't be surprised at friendships getting frayed or weird within the work drama -- expect it and show a lot of grace. Ensure that the friendship survives while you learn more about the game.

g) Have as much resources ( read as capital, leverage, equity ) as the folks sitting across the table if you want a deal that is among equals.

h) Those that are getting better are getting harder to lord over [4]. Those who get bitter are getting easier to rule over.

i) If you maintain virtue in the face where folks are telling you to try vices, over time, you will absolutely own the entire show. Listening to those who are already in some level of Dante's Inferno is not exactly the route to heaven.

j) Even the worldly figure out with or without G-d that the road to ruin is usually well mapped [5]. Avoid those roads. A good life depends on it. 

k) Never listen even for a moment to those want you to deprioritize family, faith etc around money/work. They are going to be unhappy, don't follow them. This applies even if they parade their filthy lucre and results. You don't want to have their funeral.

l) Assemble a set of elders with virtue and stick with them across decades given the grace. I was fortunate.. this was another one that I got very, very right. They will represent the true market, one that is not a voting machine.. but the weighing machine.

The remaining one truth, I hold that close to chest. It cost a fair bit and I suspect everybody has to pay a price. Happy trails.

You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me, you might be all of those things.. But if we get on the treadmill together, there's two things: You're getting off first, or I'm going to die. It's really that simple, right? " - Will Smith
