### _“ Everybody's got a right to be a sucker ... once. “_ [1]

Bit's I've learned across 14 years:

0) Fear G-d and keep His commandments [0]. This one is what got me out unscathed even as I missed the mark on the other 13 truths.

a) Moms are true prophets.. they have serious skin in the game. Time has a weird way of proving them right even if you thought they had no clue.

b) Most ventures fail. So while you listen to pied-piper visionary Steve the CEO, keep in mind basic math around "hyper-scale" or even " success " [2]. If so blessed, talk to friends who are VCs, LPs. Outcomes ranges from acquisition with double-digit % layoffs ( usually all but non-core engineering ) to absolute write-offs. The big whale outcomes are statistically a long-lost cousin of some of them mega lotteries.

c) Take care of your immigration bits and never let it be a leverage that anybody can play with over your hunt. Remember this song while you do it:

" So if you want to push, I'ma shove
If you want to spar we can do it no gloves
And if you're gonna run at me you better do it hard
Cuz I fear no fall, no brawl, no scars " [3]

d) If there is an at-will contract involved, whatever the context is. It ain't family. Run for your life if you hear how something is like family or even references to Mother Teresa. Saints are laughed out of gambling dens and if you are hearing said bits in such a den, run a few miles.

e) If you have multiple offers and one of them offers a significant pay-bump, listen to the pied piper who will pay you more even if they award you a lesser title. Watch for the fine-print in contracts.

f) Don't be surprised at friendships getting frayed or weird within the work drama -- expect it and show a lot of grace. Ensure that the friendship survives while you learn more about the game.

g) Have as much resources ( read as capital, leverage, equity ) as the folks sitting across the table if you want a deal that is among equals.

h) Those that are getting better are getting harder to lord over [4]. Those who get bitter are getting easier to rule over.

i) If you maintain virtue in the face where folks are telling you to try vices, over time, you will absolutely own the entire show. Listening to those who are already in some level of Dante's Inferno is not exactly the route to heaven.

j) Even the worldly figure out with or without G-d that the road to ruin is usually well mapped [5]. Avoid those roads. A good life depends on it. Never listen even for a moment to those want you to deprioritize family, faith etc around money. They are going to be unhappy, don't follow those suckers.

For the remaining three, I hold them close to chest. They cost a fair quid and I suspect everybody has to figure those out on their own. Happy trails.

You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me, you might be all of those things.. But if we get on the treadmill together, there's two things: You're getting off first, or I'm going to die. It's really that simple, right? " - Will Smith
