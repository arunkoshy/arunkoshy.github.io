Andrew Ng’s tips to navigate a new problem space or research topic.

### _“Reading Map“_

1. Compile a list of resources: can include papers, books, blogs et.al.
2. Skip around list
   * a) For e.g., we found five papers
   * b) Quickly skim:
     ** i) eliminate from the list
     ** ii) focus on remaining with perhaps couple that seems seminal
     ** iii) add to list
     ** iv) 5–20 papers on average is sufficient for applied work, 50-100 (or beyond) papers start approaching Ph.D./ formal research.
3. Remember 2 papers a week vs 0 papers a week is the difference between zero expertise and mastery within a year (at a very relaxed pace).

4. Quality indicators for a resource
    a) citations vs time
    b) repetition, applicability by others
